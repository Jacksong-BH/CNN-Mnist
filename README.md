# CNN-Mnist
Implementation of CNN on mnist dataset.

This program is a simple implementation of CNN on mnist datasets. The accuracy rate can easily reach 96%.
I hope this program will be an example for beginners who want to get basic understanding of CNN network and tensorflow.

You can also find the mnist datasets in the folder MNIST_data.

The script uses tensorflow to realize CNN.

The structure of CNN implemented within the script is very simple, which includes two convolution layers, two pooling layers and a full connection layer.
The number of the labels in mnist is limited to ten. Hence, softmax was used for classfication.
